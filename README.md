### Component-to-Page Code Organisation
- The components folder is a general directory for all UI elements in the application 
- There is a `Helper` and `Hoc` folder for holding generalised config information/properties 
- Each app route in the `app/` folder has a sub-folder in the components folder 
     - components/Home = components for the homepage 
     - components/Login = components for the loginpage 
- The `outline.tsx` organises/orchestrates the DOM relationships for all components of a page.
